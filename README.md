# Cloud Native Monitoring Application

# Project Overview And High Level Design

Let's start with the High Level Design.

The diagram below provides a visual representation of the services used in this project and how they are connected. This application uses Python, Docker, DockerImage, Elastic Container Registry(ECR), Elastic Kubernetes Service(EKS) and Kubernetes itself.

As we go through the project, we will discuss the services in detail and point to resources that will help you get up to speed with them.
